# Asteroid_Shape_Model_GUI_1.0
This is the repository for my OU Engineering Physics Capstone Project 

## MAIN_GUI

  contains all the necessary files to run `Asteroids_In_MASCON1.py`

### Installing `Asteroids_In_MASCON1`
  The `Asteroids_In_MASCON1_Setup.exe` can be downloaded from the "Releases" tab located on the right of this page.
  The current release is **Version_1.1**

  1. Download the `Asteroids_In_MASCON1_Setup.exe` file
  2. Locate the file and run as administrator
      - Windows will warn you that I am an Unkown publisher:

3. Next just follow the setup you can choose where to install, and if you want a desktop shortcut.

       I recommend creating the shortcut for ease of locating the software.

## Asteroid_CM

  A universal software developed to process shape models in OBJ format. Returns a file of positional data of each calculated Center of Mass for the tetrahedrons that make the polyhedron shape model. 

  This also has a method for scaling the shape model using a mean radius that can either be input by the user, or you can select to not scale the shape model.

## Apophis Recreation

  Contains preliminary work on the asteroid model Apophis, to calculate the Center of Masses for each tetrahedron within the polyhedron shape model (.obj file).
