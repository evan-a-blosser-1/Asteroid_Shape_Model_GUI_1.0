## Asteroid_CM

  A universal software developed to process shape models in OBJ format. Returns a file of positional data of each calculated Center of Mass for the tetrahedrons that make the polyhedron shape model. 

  This also has a method for scaling the shape model using a mean radius that can either be input by the user, or you can select to not scale the shape model.

## Apophis Recreation

  Contains preliminary work on the asteroid model Apophis, to calculate the Center of Masses for each tetrahedron within the polyhedron shape model (.obj file).
