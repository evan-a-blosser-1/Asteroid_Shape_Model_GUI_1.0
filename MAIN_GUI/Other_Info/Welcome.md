# Welcome

"Asteroids In MASCON 1" is a database of asteroids in the MASCON I, or Mass Concentration, system of shape modeling. MASCON is used by disecting the tetrahedrons in a polyhedron shape model and using the Center of Masses (CM) of each tetrahedron. These points act as a particle cloud inside the shape, and summing the relative distance between these points and the position orbiting body we are able to plot orbits around these asteroids and plot their gravitational field. MASCON I can be developed further to MASCON III & VIII in order to layer the shape model. This also helps to assign variosu densities for each layer. However, in MASCON I we assume a constant density.

## Shape Model Scale

Each asteroid in this database has been properly scaled to show an accurate model in kilometers. The scaling and Physical parameters use dfor the scalign can be found within each asteroid's description. 

## Asteroid Numbers?

Asteroids are numbered by when they were discoverd. This means (7) Iris was the 7th discovered asteroid. In fact (7) Iris was discoverd on August 13, 1847 by J. R. Hind and named after the Greek rainbow goddess.
